Ah, if life was only that simple for all of us. Fortunately, it is for this indie-folk-rock family outfit known as LES SAGES (pronounced Lay-Sahj), which has upped the stakes with the addition of three more members to seven total. In reality, however, there is nothing quite that simple about Les Sages. Shrouded in the exquisitely complex harmonies, poetic lyrics, hard-to-forget melodies and stunning acoustic performances are deep socio-moral messages. Whether their message is about the allure and fallacy of rejecting society for its faults (Mexique), staying true to your dreams amid naysayers (La Lutte Des Classes), the affirmation of the possibility of lasting love (Nomades) or a call to each of us to be a person that interacts with others only for good (Amis), Les Sages' theme of positivity and self-exploration rings clear. And the best part: while other bands use studio tricks to produce harmonies and counterpoints like those you'll hear on Blood Harmony, Les Sages does it for real, live, in the flesh. Blood Harmony includes new track Mexique plus acoustic-harmony versions of six songs (retitled in French) that originally appeared on the band's critically-acclaimed Deep Elm debut \"Share This.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blood Harmony is an effort to draw out the soul of the band\" says Kris Larson. He continues, \"We tried to limit instrumentation to accents and percussion and to force more weight on the vocals to carry the sonic roundness, emotion and essence of the songs.  Blood Harmony is the flavor of our childhood music-making, a giant family sitting around one guitar or one piano, each person improvising their own harmony. The decision to create this album came when we were asked to join our friends from Rock for Justice on tour raising relief funds for flood victims in Pakistan. We wanted to create a set that would be totally fun to play and easy to take on the road. This was the seed for Blood Harmony. The artwork, by our good friend and fan Bayley Brook Christensen, is an abstract visual meant to depict the the idea of blood-related siblings singing in harmony. We hope the message listeners take away from the album is that everyone is okay. Even though there are terrible things in the world, humans are resilient. We survive and have the capacity to experience joy through it all. We shouldn\u2019t allow ourselves to become frozen by fear or anxiety. We shouldn\u2019t hate the world because it is imperfect. Let's stay positive and make it a little better.\"\r\n\r\nLes Sages consists of seven (of nine) immediate siblings including original members Kris Larson, Peter Larson, Andrew Larson and Joe Larson plus Clara Larson, Annie Larson Adolphson and John Larson.  On this release, all members switched off between vocals and playing celesta, piano, guitar, djembe, tambourine and various other percussion instruments. Blood Harmony was recorded and produced by Les Sages at their home studios in Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah. Deep Elm also released the band's full-length \"Share This\" (2010) as well as the innovative theatrical album \"Animals\" (2008). The Larson clan was born in Alberta, Canada and at a very young age entered into their existence as nomads (see lyrics for Nomades) residing in over a dozen cities both domestically and overseas before settling in Utah.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything Les Sages touches turns to gold.

Ahhh, if life were only that simple. Fortunately for this incredibly talented band of four brothers, songwriting is. Listen to any track on this album - any one - and stop there. You won't, you can't...it's just that good. Whether their message is about rethinking boundaries (The League War), sacrificing for a better future (The Soldier's Mark), being a true friend (Friends), proving that love can last infinitely (Nomads) or taking action (Red Lights), Les Sages' theme of positivity and self-exploration rings clear. And while other bands use studio tricks to produce gorgeous harmonies, counterpoints and melodies like those you'll hear on Share This, Les Sages does it authentically with a combination of four separate, sincere voices and poetic yet biting lyrics. \"Our songs have a deep socio-moral message. Through our music and lyrics, we'd like to be like a best friend to all those who listen\" says Kris Larson. \"The title of the album is meant to enlist each and every listener to help in spreading our message. This record is all about finding real happiness. It's about following your dreams, taking chances and making sacrifices to make this world a better place. A lofty goal? Yes, but worthy. Are we gonna do it? We'll die trying\" adds Joe Larson. Destined to be one of the most memorable records ever released on Deep Elm, if this album doesn't speak to you, none will. (DER-503)\r\n\r\n\"Deep Elm Records has done it once again, discovering four brothers called Les Sages. I put their new album 'Share This' is in a group of periodically published super albums, because albums like this are not released that frequently. It's so impressive that I would even say Jimmy Eat World's 'Clarity' could stand in it's shadow. It's very reminiscient of that special feeling I got when I first heard Jimmy Eat World and /or Taking Back Sunday. Les Sages is our Featured Artist until further notice.\" - Punk76\r\n\r\n\"The nice thing with Deep Elm is that all the albums they release can be bought with your eyes closed. We know of course the quality of the label's roster, but with each new group they sign, we know that we will discover something unique. When I saw the label that was associated with this group, I immediately listened. I was completely captivated by these 11 aggressive yet fragile indie-pop songs. It's very simple, since I started playing Share This it's never left my turntable. Their sound has a \"je ne sais quoi\" new feeling to it. In fact, if Taking Back Sunday slowed the tempo to some Brand New's songs that were arranged by Death Cab for Cutie and Say Anything, and the whole lot was shaken for forty minutes, it would produce the best kept secrets of Les Sages. The League War and Friends completes with the best of Brand New with such amazing melodies. But the main force that makes all the difference is the voices. All group members sing, and the combination of those four vocals give a magical effect to every song. Reinvention and Mumbled are the perfect example. With almost post-rock crystalline guitars and piano, it is breathtaking beauty. In fact, everything that the group touches turns to gold. Nomads competes with the best of Death Cab and the chorus rivals the legendary Jimmy Eat World. The big rock Red Lights and Driver Of the Hearse might have found their place on a Say Anything album. The use of the piano is always wise and never pompous, providing the emotion and space. Action, the bluesy Tricks and above all The Soldier's Mark are all mastered to perfection and will affect anyone with a heart. The Soldier's Mark is the finest song of the album, the lyrics vibrate with melody and transport you elsewhere. It's impossible not to be shocked after hearing Share This, especially for a group that I didn't know about a week ago. A no-fault album of indie-pop the likes of which we have not heard of for a long time. No gimmicks, no posing...just four humble brothers in the service of music. I'm sure they're not even aware they have just released an album that can compete successfully with the very best.\" - Alternativ News\r\n\r\nwww.deepelm.com/lessages", "album_id": 1147351318, "url": "http://deepelmdigital.com/album/share-this?pk=30", "release_date": 1272931200, "title": "Share This", "large_art_url": "http://f1.bcbits.com/img/a3303117944_5.jpg", "tracks": [{"lyrics": "JOE: I'm in love.

Our major influences on the album include Copeland, The Early November, Matchbook Romance, The Arcade Fire, Johnny Cash, The Killers, Bright Eyes and The Faint. Animals is named for the diversity of its songs, like an entire zoo of different animals. We also felt like the dramatic polarity of emotions throughout the album gives it an animalistic character\" says Joe Larson.
